A work in progress, and a continuous exercise for the senses.\n\nI started it in 2008 while living in Spain for a couple of years. I had discovered whisky a few years earlier but suddenly I was cut off from festivals, shops and whisky friends in my home country. A whisky blog seemed a good way of keeping in touch. It quickly gained a following, first in Belgium but now from all over the world.\n\n# BeautifulSoup package\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*muxhw09mECD24fZqJXKH1A.jpeg){width=\"500\"}\n\nBeautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
